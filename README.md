### Seminar 1, 2024-09-18 10:00-12:00, Jupiter 273

Prepare for the discussion by reading/checking the following material **before** coming to the seminar:
- [Grohnert2024](https://github.com/robertfeldt/supervising_se_research/blob/main/related_work/grohnert_2024_effective_masters_thesis_supervision_a_summative_framework.pdf), Grohnert et al (2024), "Effective master’s thesis supervision – A summative framework for
research and practice"
- [Feldt2010](https://github.com/robertfeldt/supervising_se_research/tree/main/related_work/feldt_BTH_SE_thesis_materials) Feldt (2010), "Process and rubrics for the BTH SE Master Thesis course", 2007-2010

When reading/checking these sources be sure to take some notes and reflect on how it matches with your own experience (or, if you haven't yet supervised) what you plan to do in and approach your future supervision.

For this first seminar, you can focus on the process description and the proposal rubric of Feldt2010, but feel free to also check out the other rubrics to get a sense for how they were used throughout the process.
